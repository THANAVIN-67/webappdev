    <h1>LARB MOO's Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      Larb is sort of like the meat sibling of som tam; They are made from different ingredients, but go incredibly well together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It’s a staple dish of Thai Isaan food, it’s easy to make, and it’s a brilliant combination of ingredients. A spoon of larb  followed by a ball of fresh sticky rice, is one of the great flavor combinations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>About 5 tablespoons of toasted rice</li>
      <li>300 grams (1 pound) minced pork </li>
      <li>½ - 1 tablespoon of chili flakes </li>
      <li>⅛ tablespoon of sugar </li>
      <li>½ tablespoon of fish sauce </li>
      <li>1 - 2 limes </li>
      <li>3 - 4 small shallots </li>
      <li>A few leaves of Culantro </li>
      <li>3 - 5 spring onions </li>
      <li>About 20 leaves or so of fresh mint </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <h3>Toasted sticky rice (khao kua)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First step is to make the toasted rice
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan on low heat, toss in the uncooked Thai sticky rice (no oil). Stir continuously, kind of like you’re roasting peanuts or coffee. Toast the rice until it turns from white to golden yellow, almost to the point where it looks like brown wheat. It will also be very fragrant and smell almost like popcorn. It took me about 15 minutes or so.
      </li>

Once the rice is finished toasting, and has cooled off a bit, put it into your stone mortar and pestle. Pound the rice until it turns into a coarse powder (a blender or food processor will also work fine). Put your toasted sticky rice powder in a bowl aside.

    </ol>
    <h3>Larb recipe</h3>
    <ol>      
      <li>
Add 300 grams of minced pork to a small sized saucepan with a handle. Fry the pork, breaking it into small minced pieces, until it’s fully cooked all the way through. For best flavor, leave all the oils that come out (but if you want to be healthier, you can also drain the pork oil, and add in a splash of water instead). Take the pork off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
Leaving the pork in the same pot, add 1 heaping tablespoon of the toasted rice powder into the pork. Also toss in ½ - 1 tablespoon of chili flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
Add a pinch of sugar, ½ tablespoon of fish sauce, and squeeze in the juice from 1 - 2 limes
      </li>
      <li>
        Give the pork and the seasoning a quick stir.
      </li>
      <li>
Peel and slice the shallots, finely mince about 5 green onions and a few culantro leaves (if you have them), and just pluck about 20 or so mint leaves off the stem. Throw everything into the saucepan with the pork.
      </li>
      <li>
Give the larb moo a good mix, making sure all the spices and dressing coats the pork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste test. See if it needs more fish sauce for saltiness, lime juice, or chili flakes. Get it the way you want it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dish it out onto a plate and garnish with more mint leaves, Thai sweet basil, and culantro.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        In Thailand, larb moo  is normally eaten along with a plate of Thai sticky rice and accompanied by a plate of som tam (green papaya salad).
